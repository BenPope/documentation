Node maintenance mode enables you to take a Redpanda node offline temporarily while minimizing disruption to client operations. When a node is in maintenance mode, you can safely perform operations that require the Redpanda process to be temporarily stopped; for example, replacing a disk, power cycling a node, or performing a [rolling upgrade](/docs/cluster-administration/rolling-upgrade).

When a node is placed in maintenance mode, it reassigns partition leadership to other nodes in the cluster. The node is not eligible for partition leadership again until it is taken out of maintenance mode.

If a node hosts a partition with a replica count of 1, you have three options:

* Manually reassign the partition to another node by changing its replica set.
* Increase the number of replicas.
* Do nothing, but be aware that the partition will not be available while the redpanda process is shut down temporarily.

Maintenance mode only transfers leadership; it does not move any partitions to other nodes in the cluster. The amount of time it takes to drain a node and reassign leadership depends on the number of partitions and how healthy the cluster is. For healthy clusters, draining leadership should take less than a minute. If the cluster is unhealthy (for example, a follower is lagging behind), then draining the node can take even longer. Note that the draining process wonâ€™t start until the cluster is healthy.

When a node is in maintenance mode, Redpanda continues to replicate follower partition data to that node. If the node becomes unreachable, then the cluster could accumulate under-replicated partitions until the node becomes available. As soon as the node is upgraded, it becomes reachable, and any data that was not able to be replicated will then be replicated.

## Placing a node in maintenance mode

Before placing a node in maintenance mode, you may want to temporarily disable or ignore alerts related to under-replicated partitions.

To place a node into maintenance mode:

```bash
rpk cluster maintenance enable <node-id> --wait
```

The `--wait` option ensures that `rpk` waits until leadership is drained from the node before responding.

To remove a node from maintenance mode (and thus enable the node to start taking leadership of partitions):

```bash
rpk cluster maintenance disable <node-id> 
```

To see the maintenance status of nodes in the cluster:

```bash
rpk cluster maintenance status
```

The output of this command identifies which nodes in the cluster are in the process of draining leadership, which nodes are finished with that process, and whether any nodes had resulting errors.

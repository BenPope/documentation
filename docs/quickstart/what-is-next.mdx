title: What is next?

Now that Redpanda is appropriately running in your environment, you can start using many features and configurations on your instance.

Creating an application to interact with your Redapand cluster using [NodeJS](/docs/deployment/guide-nodejs) is a good start for developers.

As a recommendation, add a layer of security to your environment. For that, apply features like [authorization and authentication](/docs/security/acls) or [TLS encryption for Kubernetes](/docs/security/tls-kubernetes), especially in a production environment. Note that changes in the configuration files, not only from a local machine but also for Kubernetes and Docker, require a cluster restart.

For more Kubernetes setup information, check our [custom configuration in Kubernetes](/docs/deployment/kubernetes-additional-config) or [how to connect remotely to Kubernetes](/docs/deployment/kubernetes-external-connect) guides.

For more detailed information about our `rpk` commands, check our [overview page](/docs/reference/rpk-commands) to help you quickly configure and interact with the topics.

You can also check our blog for announcements and technical overviews of our latest features.

title: Encryption, authorization, and authentication

By default, Redpanda has no security enabled. Any client can talk over plaintext to Redpanda and perform any operation. For best defense, always enable encryption, and always use authorization and authentication. While _authentication_ tells who you are, _authorization_ tells what you can do.

All concepts described in this section are compatible with Kafka and its client libraries and CLIs. This section does not cover ways you can protect your Redpanda cluster externally; for example, through network ACLs or private networks.

## Prerequisites

- A running Redpanda node: See [Quick Start guides](/docs/quickstart/).

- TLS certificates: You don't need TLS for testing, but TLS certificates are necessary for encryption. You can use your own certificates, either self-signed or issued by a trusted Certificate Authority, or use use our [prepared script](https://gist.github.com/0x5d/56422a0c447e58d8ccbfa0ce1fd6bac6) to generate certificates:

  ```bash
  bash <(curl -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/0x5d/56422a0c447e58d8ccbfa0ce1fd6bac6/raw/933ca97702f6b844f706b674133105a30bdad3ff/generate-certs.sh)
  ```

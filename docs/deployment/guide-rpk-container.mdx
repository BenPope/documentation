The `rpk container` command, which leverages Docker, is a quick way to stand up a local multi-node cluster
for testing. 

:::note
You don't need to interact with Docker directly, but you do need to install it. See Docker installation instructions for
[Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or [MacOS](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

To run Redpanda in a three-node cluster: 

`rpk container start -n 3`

The command output shows the addresses of the cluster nodes:

```bash
$ rpk container start -n 3
Starting cluster
Waiting for the cluster to be ready...
  NODE ID  ADDRESS          
  0        127.0.0.1:49462  
  1        127.0.0.1:49468  
  2        127.0.0.1:49467  
```

You now have a three-node cluster running Redpanda. The first time you run `rpk container start`, it downloads an image matching the version. (To check it, run: `rpk version`.)

You can run `rpk` commands to interact with the cluster. For example:

```bash
rpk cluster info --brokers 127.0.0.1:49462,127.0.0.1:49468,127.0.0.1:49467
```

You can now connect your Kafka-compatible applications directly to Redpanda
by using the ports listed in the command output. In this example, the ports are
`58754`, `58757`, and `58756`.

Additionally, all `rpk topic` subcommands detect the local cluster and use its addresses, so you don't need to configure anything or keep track of IP addresses and ports.

For example, you can run `rpk topic create`:

```bash
$ rpk topic create -p 6 -r 3 new-topic --brokers <broker1_address>,<broker2_address>...
Created topic 'new-topic'. Partitions: 6, replicas: 3, cleanup policy: 'delete'
```

To stop the cluster:

```bash
rpk container stop
```

You can now use Redpanda to test Kafka-compatible applications, or use the `rpk topic` commands to interact with the local cluster.

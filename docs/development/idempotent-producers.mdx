title: Idempotent producers
---

Idempotent producers guarantee that the client writes a message to a topic only once. Under stable conditions, this is expected. But in the event of a disruption, the client retries the write request until an acknowledgment is received from the broker or the retry limit is reached. When a write request is sent multiple times, idempotence ensures that the message is only written once.

Idempotent producers assign a unique ID to every write request. This request ID consists of the producer ID and a sequence number. The sequence number identifies the order in which each write request was sent. If new write requests continue while a previous request is being retried, the new requests are stored in order in memory to preserve the correct sequence. The client must also retry these requests.

If a retry results in a duplicate message, Redpanda software identifies the duplicate based on its request ID and removes it.

The `enable_idempotence` property is enabled by default. This property is set at the cluster level, which means the setting applies to all nodes in the cluster. To disable idempotence, refer to [Configuring cluster properties](/docs/cluster-administration/cluster-property-configuration).

:::note

Idempotence is guaranteed within a session. If the system is restarted, a new session starts, and any write requests that were stored in memory are erased. Also, if you manually retry a write request, the client will assign a new ID to that request and the original sequencing will be lost.

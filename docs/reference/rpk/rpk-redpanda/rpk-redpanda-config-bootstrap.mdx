Initialize the configuration to bootstrap a cluster.

This command expects the machine it's running on to have only one private non-loopback IP address associated to it. It uses that in the configuration as the node's address.

### Usage

```
rpk redpanda config bootstrap [--self] [--ips <ip1,ip2,...>] [flags]
```

### Flags

| --config          | string         |   Redpanda configuration file. If not set, the file is searched for in the default location.|
| h, --help         | -              |  Help for bootstrap.                          |
| --id              | int            |  Sets the node ID in `redpanda.yaml`. If not set, Redpanda assigns one automatically.   |
| --ips             | string         |  Comma-separated list of known node addresses or hostnames.      |
| --self            | string         |  Hint at this node's IP address from within the list passed in <code>--ips</code>.<br/><br/>If the cluster has multiple IPs, <code>--self</code> must be specified. In that case, the given IP is used without checking whether it's among the machine's addresses or not.  |
| -v, --verbose     | -              |  Enable verbose logging (default <code>false</code>).                          |
